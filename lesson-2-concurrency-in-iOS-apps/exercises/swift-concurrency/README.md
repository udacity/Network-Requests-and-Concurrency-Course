### Exercise: Swift Concurrency

## Overview

This exercise is a continuation of the TripJournal app. You will refactor the app to use Swift's async/await for managing asynchronous operations in the networking code, ensuring that all UI updates are performed on the main thread.

#### Objectives
- Refactor networking code to utilize async/await.
- Manage asynchronous operations using async/await.
- Ensure UI updates are performed on the main thread.

#### Instructions

1. **Starter:**
   - Navigate to the starter folder and open TripJournal.xcodeproj.
   - Your task is to fill in the missing code as indicated by comments in the Swift files (JournalServiceLive.swift, AuthView.swift, LoggedInView.swift).
   - Follow the steps outlined in the comments within each file to complete the exercise.


2. **Solution:**
   - After you complete the exercise, or if you need to check your work, you can find the complete code in the solution folder.
   - Compare your solution with the completed code to understand different approaches or to debug any issues you encountered.

#### Setup
- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Open the Xcode project from the `starter` folder to begin the exercise.
