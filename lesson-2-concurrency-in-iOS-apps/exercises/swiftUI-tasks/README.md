### Exercise: SwiftUI Tasks

## Overview

This exercise is a continuation of the TripJournal app. You will refactor the app to use SwiftUI's `Task` modifier for managing asynchronous operations, ensuring that tasks are properly managed and canceled when no longer needed.

#### Objectives
- Use the `Task` modifier to manage asynchronous operations.
- Cancel tasks when they are no longer needed.
- Ensure state changes and UI updates are properly handled.

#### Instructions

1. **Starter:**
   - Navigate to the starter folder and open `TripJournal.xcodeproj`.
   - Your task is to fill in the missing code as indicated by comments in the Swift files (`AuthView.swift`, `TripList.swift`, `TripForm.swift`).

2. **Solution:**
   - After you complete the exercise, or if you need to check your work, you can find the complete code in the solution folder.
   - Compare your solution with the completed code to understand different approaches or to debug any issues you encountered.

#### Setup
- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Open the Xcode project from the `starter` folder to begin the exercise.

Feel free to reach out if you encounter any difficulties or have questions regarding the exercises.

Happy coding!
