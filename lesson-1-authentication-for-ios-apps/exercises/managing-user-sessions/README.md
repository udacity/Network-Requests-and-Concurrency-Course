### Exercise: Managing User Sessions

## Overview

This exercise is a continuation of the TripJournal app. You will learn how to manage user sessions by implementing an expirable token system and handling session expiration. This ensures that users are automatically logged out and informed when their session expires.

#### Objectives
- Implement an expirable authentication token system.
- Detect when the authentication token has expired and log out the user.
- Display an alert to inform the user that the session has expired.
- Redirect the user to the login screen upon session expiration.

#### Instructions

1. **Starter:**
   - Navigate to the `starter` folder and open `TripJournal.xcodeproj`.
   - Your task is to fill in the missing code as indicated by comments in the Swift files (`JournalServiceLive.swift`, `Token.swift`, `LoggedInView.swift`).
   - Follow the steps outlined in the comments within each file to complete the exercise.


2. **Solution:**
   - After you complete the exercise, or if you need to check your work, you can find the complete code in the `solution` folder.
   - Compare your solution with the completed code to understand different approaches or to debug any issues you encountered.

#### Setup
- Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed on your Mac.
- Open the Xcode project from the `starter` folder to begin the exercise.
